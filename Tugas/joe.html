            <p>A young boy is orphaned when his father is murdered. Twenty years later, the boy has grown into a talented and deadly martial arts fighter, driven by a desire to avenge his father. To conceal his true identity, he calls himself "Snake Eyes", a name inspired when his father's murderer forced him to roll a pair of weighted dice to determine his fate, killing him when he rolled double ones.

                Wealthy Yakuza boss Kenta Takamura discovers Snake Eyes in an underground fighting circuit located in Los Angeles. Kenta offers to find his father's killer if Snake Eyes will work for him, to which Snake Eyes accepts. When Snake Eyes is asked to prove his loyalty by shooting a man who betrayed Kenta's trust, Snake Eyes refuses and instead helps the traitor escape. The traitor is Kenta's cousin, Tommy. Tommy and Kenta were both in line to lead the Arashikage clan, an ancient ninja society devoted to preserving order and fighting evil. Kenta sought to kill his cousin, but failed and was banished.
                
                Grateful to Snake Eyes, Tommy takes him to his ninja dojo in Tokyo, Japan and asks that he be initiated as a member. The current clan leader, Sen, Tommy's grandmother, agrees to let Snake Eyes undergo three trials to determine if he is worthy. The clan's head of security, Akiko, does not trust Snake Eyes at first, but he wins her trust by revealing his father's murder and explains that is why there is no recorded history of him. Unbeknownst to anyone, Snake Eyes plans to betray his new allies. Tommy's attempted murder and escape is shown to have been staged by Kenta in order to get Snake Eyes close enough to steal the clan's most sacred treasure, the "Jewel of the Sun", which has magical powers.
                
                Snake Eyes finds himself increasingly torn between his guilt over betraying Tommy, the clan, and his overwhelming desire for revenge. He passes the first two trials with his exceptional talents. Snake Eyes and Tommy learn that Kenta is back in Tokyo and aligning with the terrorist revolutionary organization Cobra. Kenta explains to Snake Eyes that he is tasked to steal the jewel on behalf of Cobra. Cobra, through their liaison, the Baroness, has been arming Kenta with weapons so that he can seize control of the Arashikage clan. Kenta and Baroness inform Snake Eyes that they have his father's murderer imprisoned, and will release him if Snake does not secure the jewel for them.
                
                The third and final trial requires his spirit to be tested by sacred anacondas, who can sense if he is truly pure of heart. Due to Snake Eyes' secrets, the snakes attack him, but Akiko saves him from being killed. Confronted by the clan, Snake Eyes admits that he has not been entirely honest, but manages to hide the true reason he is there, and is expelled.
                
                Snake Eyes later returns in secret and steals the jewel using his knowledge of the clan's temple, delivering it to Kenta. Snake Eyes receives his reward for stealing the jewel: his fatherâ€™s killer, who turns out to be a Cobra agent. Having realized what his bloodlust has cost him, Snake Eyes spares the man and instead goes back to the Arashikage clan to warn them of Kenta's attack.
                
                Tommy puts aside his anger and lets Snake Eyes assist him and the clan's warriors, including Scarlett, a member of the international peacekeeping organization G.I. Joe, in fighting off Kenta's men. After Kenta admits that he has no intention of handing over the jewel, the Baroness forms a temporary alliance with the Arashikage clan and Scarlett. With his men defeated, Kenta loses the jewel to Tommy, who overwhelmed with fury tries to use its power to kill Kenta. Kenta manages to escape, but Snake Eyes traps him in the anaconda pit, where the snakes devour Kenta upon sensing his evil spirit. The snakes then judge Snake Eyes to now be pure of heart for forgoing his lust for revenge, thus now being worthy of joining the clan.
                
                After the battle, Sen strips Tommy of his birthright to lead the clan for breaking his vow never to use the jewel. Enraged, Tommy forsakes the clan and family, vowing to kill Snake Eyes if should they ever meet again. Snake Eyes meets with Scarlett who, after explaining that his father was a G.I. Joe agent, offers him a chance to become a Joe.
                
                In a mid-credits scene, on a private jet leaving Japan, the Baroness recruits Tommy into Cobra, and Tommy has renamed himself "Storm Shadow".</p>
